Cognitive AI Project: Mouse Stimulus Testing
This project aims to investigate the cognitive abilities of mice by examining their ability to distinguish between different stimuli and determine if they possess memory that influences their responses to the stimuli. The research is based on papers exploring mouse One-Legged-Rearing (OLR) motion.

Introduction
The research focuses on studying the cognitive abilities of mice through experiments designed to evaluate their response to different stimuli. By analyzing their behavior during the One-Legged-Rearing motion, we aim to gain insights into their decision-making processes and memory capabilities.

Project Goals
Determine if mice can distinguish between two different stimuli.
Investigate whether mice exhibit memory effects in relation to their current reactions to the stimuli.
Contribute to the existing body of knowledge regarding mouse OLR motion and cognitive abilities.
Experimental Design
The experimental design includes the following key components:

Stimuli: Two distinct visual or auditory cues will be presented to the mice.
Training Phase: Mice will undergo a training phase to familiarize them with the stimuli and establish behavioral responses.
Testing Phase: Mice will be subjected to various tests to assess their ability to discriminate between the stimuli and observe any memory effects.
Data Collection
Data will be collected through video recordings and motion-tracking software during the experiments. The following data points will be captured:

Mouse behavior during stimulus presentation
Reaction times
Distance covered during One-Legged-Rearing motion
Data Analysis
The collected data will be analyzed using statistical methods such as:

Hypothesis testing to determine if mice exhibit a significant ability to distinguish between stimuli.
Correlation analysis to investigate any relationship between memory effects and current reactions.
Visualization techniques to present the findings effectively.
