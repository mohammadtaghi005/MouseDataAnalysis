# Cognitive AI Mouse Experiment

This project aims to investigate the ability of mice to distinguish between two different stimuli and examine if mice can form memories that affect their current reactions to the stimuli. The experiment is based on papers about mouse OLR (One-Legged-Rodent) motion.

**Note:** This README file provides an overview of the project and its components. For detailed information regarding the experiment setup, data collection, and analysis, please refer to the relevant documentation and research papers cited in the repository.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to explore the cognitive abilities of mice by conducting experiments that involve stimuli differentiation and memory formation. By studying and analyzing mouse behavior in response to specific stimuli, we aim to gain insights into their cognitive processes and potential memory-based decision-making.

## Experimental Design

The experiment consists of two main parts:

1. **Stimuli Differentiation:** In this phase, mice are exposed to two different stimuli, A and B, and their responses are recorded. The goal is to determine whether mice can distinguish between these two stimuli based on their behavioral reactions.

2. **Memory Formation and Recall:** In this phase, mice are initially exposed to stimuli A and B, and their responses are recorded. After a certain period of time, the mice are re-exposed to the same stimuli, and their reactions are observed and compared to their initial responses. This phase aims to assess whether mice can form memories that influence their subsequent reactions to the stimuli.

## Data Collection

To collect data, the following methods and tools are utilized:

- **Experimental Setup:** A controlled environment is created where mice are introduced to the stimuli and their responses are recorded using appropriate sensors or tracking systems.

- **Sensor/Tracking Data:** Various sensors or tracking systems, such as cameras or motion sensors, are used to capture the mice's movements and behavioral responses during the experiments. This data is stored for further analysis.

## Data Analysis

The collected data is analyzed using various statistical and computational methods, including but not limited to:

- **Statistical Tests:** Statistical tests, such as t-tests or chi-square tests, may be performed to determine if there are significant differences in the mice's responses between stimuli A and B, or between the initial and subsequent exposures.

- **Data Visualization:** Data visualization techniques, such as plots or graphs, may be employed to present and interpret the findings of the experiments in a clear and understandable manner.

## Results

The results of the experiments will be documented and presented in a comprehensive manner. These findings will provide insights into the cognitive abilities of mice, specifically their capability to differentiate between stimuli and form memory-based responses.
